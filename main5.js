console.log("Objects containing other objects");

// Let's remember our Product class

class Product {

	constructor(name, price) {
		this.name = name;
		this.price = price;
	}

	toString() {
		return this.name + " " + this.price + "â‚¬";
	}
}

// And create a couple of products
let p1 = new Product("vacuum cleaner", 100);
let p2 = new Product("pencil", 3);
let p3 = new Product("bike", 300);


// Now, let's create a ShoppingCart class, that will contain products

class ShoppingCart {

	constructor() {
		this.products = []; // empty at 
        this.priceArray = [];
        this.totalPrice = 0
	}

	addProduct(product) {
		this.products.push(product);
	}
    
    getTotalPrice() {
        this.priceArray = this.products.map(x => x.price)
        this.totalPrice = this.priceArray.reduce((a, b) => a + b)
    }

	toString() {
		return "cart with: " + this.products + ". And the total price is: " + this.totalPrice;
	}
}


// We can create a cart and add the products we created before

let cart = new ShoppingCart();
cart.addProduct(p1);
cart.addProduct(p2);
cart.addProduct(p3);

console.log("We have a " + cart);

cart.getTotalPrice();
console.log("We have a " + cart);


//1) In ShoppingCart, define a method totalPrice() that returns the total amount of the products it contains.
//
//2) Now let's say that, if you buy 5 products or more, you have a 10% of discount. Change totalPrice to reflect this calculation.
//
//3) Besides the previous discount, if you buy 3 items of the same type (e.g. 3 pencils) you may get one more for free. So, if you buy 4 pencils you only pay 3, if you buy 8 pencils you only pay 6, etc. Change totalPrice so it considers the free items you get. Notice that if you buy 3 pencils you just pay the 3 of them.
//
//4) Sometimes a product is sold out and has to be replaced by a new one. Add a method replace(productName, replacementProduct) that looks for products with productName and replaces them by new instances of the product like replacementProduct. Notice that productName is a string, and replacementProduct is a Product. Also, bear in mind that you don't have to add the replacementProduct itself to the cart, but create new products like that one (whenever necessary).
